AI models, trained on the PancreaVerse dataset, match senior and expert radiologists in tumor detection and surpasses them in tumor classification accuracy.

| **dataset** | **# of class** | **# of CT** | **# of center** |
|-----------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| MSD-Pancreas | 2 | 420 | 1 |
| TCIA-CBCT | 0 | 40 | 1 |
| TCIA-panNET | 0 | 38 | 1 |
| PANORAMA | 6 | 3,000 | 7 |
| PancreaVerse | 27 | 25,362 | 112 |

PancreaVerse comprises **25,362** CT scans with precise per-voxel annotations of **benign and malignant pancreatic tumors**, **pancreas head, body, and tail**, along with **24** surrounding structures (i.e., *pancreas, superior mesenteric artery, pancreatic duct, celiac artery, common bile duct, veins, aorta, gall bladder, left and right kidneys, liver, postcava, spleen, stomach, left and right adrenal glands, bladder, colon, duodenum, left and right femurs, left and right lungs, and prostate*). Sourced from **112** hospitals, this dataset includes imaging **metadata** such as patient sex, age, contrast phase, diagnosis, spacing, and scanner details. 

This dataset enables standard medical imaging tasks—detection, segmentation, and classification—and clinical tasks such as tumor staging and radiotherapy planning.
